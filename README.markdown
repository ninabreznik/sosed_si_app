### PREPARE SYSTEM
  * install ruby on rails environment
  * install [git](http://git-scm.com "git") if it is not yet installed on your system
  * install [node](http://nodejs.org "nodejs") if it is not yet installed on your system
  * open a terminal on your system and navigate to your favourite workspace folder
    * _(you might need to prefix some of the following commands with `sudo` to make them work)_

### START PREPARING LEADSHAREAPP PROJECT
* `git clone https://github.com/ninabreznik/LeadShareApp.git`
* `npm install`
* `npm update`
* `bundle install`
* `rake db:migrate`
* `npm start & rails s`
* load the APP by opening and pointing your browser to: `http://localhost:3000/`
  * __HINT1:__ this might only works with CORS disabled. In order to do so:
    * mac osx `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security`
    * linux `google-chrome --disable-web-security`
    * windows `chrome.exe --disable-web-security`
  * __HINT2:__ the server can be administrated through _(e.g. localhost:3000/admin)_
    * __user:__ admin@example.com
    * __pass:__ password

__... HAPPY CODING :-)__


* How to shorten feedback cycles during development
(Process to use for projects, where dependencies projects have to be developed in parallel to the main project)
In order to use changes made in a dependency project, they have to be commited and pushed and the version has to be increased and published.
Afterwards, in the main project, the version for the updated dependency has to be adapted in `package.json` and `npm install` has to be run.
That is a lot of hassle to be done for each change.

* Solution
__Given:__ "Main Project" and "Dependency Project" are both `git clone`'ed to the local developer machine.
__Process:__
0. Open all those Project Folders in sublime editor and then use the terminal to...
1. Go to the "Dependency Project" repository and increase the "Version Number" in the `package.json` file, but don't `git push`.
2. Run `npm link` in the root directory of the "Dependency Project" repository.
3. Go to the "Main Project" repository and increase the "Version Number" of the "Dependency Project" in the `package.json` file.
4. Run `npm link 'dependency name'` in the root directory of the "Main Project" repository.
That's it, execute `npm start` in the "Main Project" repository and start hacking...

__Finishing:__ After all changes are done to both projects and you are satisfied with the result...
1. Go to the "Main Project" repository and run `npm link 'dependency name'` in the root directory.
2. Go to the "Dependency Project" repository and run `npm unlink` in the root directory.
3. Then `git commit` and `git push` all the changes to publish the new version.
4. Go to the "Main Project" repository and run `npm install` to get the new version of the dependency you just updated.

That's it.
